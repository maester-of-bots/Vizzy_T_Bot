    "*A dragon's saddle is one thing, but the Iron Throne is the most dangerous seat in the realm.*",
    "*A truly great Targaryen King I am. Powerless over mine own daughter of seven and ten.*",
    "*Be welcome! I know many of you have traveled long leagues to be at these games. But I promise, you will not be disappointed!*",

    "*This is an occasion for celebration, it seems.*",
    "*I had a black mare once. Black like a raven. One day, she escaped her pasture and he neighboring stallion sired a foal on her. The stallion was as silver as the moon on a winter's night and the foal, when it was born, chestnut. Just the most unremarkable brown horse you ever saw. Nature is a thing of mysterious works.*",
    "*Tongues will not change the succession, let them wag.*",
    "*Well... the matter is settled.  Again.  I hereby reaffirm Prince Lucerys of House Velaryon as heir to Driftmark, the Driftwood Throne, and the next Lord of the Tides. (WHEEZING)*",

    "*You are my political headache.*",
    "*You are to return to Runestone and your lady wife at once, and you are to do so without quarrel by order of your King.*",
    "YOU SPEND MORE TIME IN THAT BATH THAN I DO ON THE THRONE!",
    "*Your mother's absence is a wound that will never heal. Without her, the Red Keep has lost a warmth that I dare say it will never recover.*",
    "You wear a crown. Do you also call yourself 'king'?",
    "What is this shadow? Name it, if it casts such a gloom",
    "You are a plague sent to destroy me!",
